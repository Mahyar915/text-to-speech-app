# Text-to-Speech Web Application

This project is a **Flask-based** web application that converts user-provided text into speech using **Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** engine. The application features an intuitive web interface where users can input text, select language preferences, and download the generated audio files. It demonstrates the integration of Python libraries with web development to create an accessible, user-friendly solution.

## Key Features:

- User-friendly web interface for text input and audio playback.
- Supports multiple languages for text-to-speech conversion.
- Allows users to download the generated audio file.
- Built with **Flask** for backend processing and **HTML/CSS** for frontend design.
